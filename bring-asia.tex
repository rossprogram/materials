\item \textbf{What to bring?}
 \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),itemsep=0.5em,topsep=0em]
 \item Bring clothes suitable for hot, humid summer weather 
   outside, along with cool
   temperatures inside air-conditioned buildings.  Bring (or plan to
   purchase) \linebreak personal toiletries like soap, shampoo, deodorant,
   toothbrush and toothpaste, comb, brush, nail clippers, etc.
   Clean sheets, pillowcase, and towel are provided weekly. 
% \item Bring a pillow.  Clean sheets, pillowcase, and towel are provided weekly.  However, pillows are not distributed by the dorm staff.  You may bring your own pillow, or purchase a pillow after you arrive.

 \item A microwave oven and small refrigerator will be available in
   the dorm lobby.  Those appliances are not provided in student
   rooms.
 \item Washers and Dryers are available in the dorm at no charge.  The
   Ross Program will provide bottles of detergent for everyone to use.
 \item You may bring school supplies like paper, pencils, pens,
   notebooks.  But there will also be opportunities to purchase those
   items after you arrive.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{What not to bring?}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),itemsep=0.5em,topsep=0em]
  \item Do not bring electronic equipment like a computer, laptop,
    tablet, gaming system, music player with speakers, etc.  
    Counselors will confiscate such equipment, if you bring it to the
    Ross Program.
  \item Student cell phones are permitted, but their use is
    restricted: Make telephone calls only within your dorm room.
    Please do not use your phone to play games, surf the internet, or
    look up information that undercuts the process of your
    mathematical explorations.
  \item Do not bring math books, number theory textbooks, or other references.  
    The Ross Number Theory course is self-contained, with no need for 
    outside texts.
  \item Do not bring valuable items, or large amounts of cash.  The
    campus is a relatively safe place, with little crime.  But
    outsiders can sometimes sneak into the dormitory building and look
    for open doors when no one is there.
  \item Do not plan other activities while at the Ross Program. All of 
    your time, effort, and focus will be on the Ross courses and problem 
    sets.  There is no opportunity for you to take an on-line course, 
    prepare  for the SAT, write essays for your upcoming English 
    class, or read the book recommended by your college advisor.
  \item There is free time for students to play outdoor games (soccer, Ultimate, 
    basketball, etc), or to play music on a University piano or your own 
    instrument.   However, preparing for some future tests or classes uses up 
    the intellectual energy that should be spent on Ross math problems!
