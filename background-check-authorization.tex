\maketitle

I, \blank{3in}{name}{name}, authorize the Ross Mathematics Foundation
to conduct a criminal background check and to check state and federal
sex offender registries for purposes of evaluating whether I am
qualified for the position for which I am applying.

I understand that the Ross Mathematics Foundation will utilize an
outside firm (or firms) to assist it in checking such information and
registries, and I specifically authorize such an investigation by
information services and outside entities of the Ross Mathematics
Foundation's choice.

I also understand that I may withhold my permission and that in such a
case, no investigation will be done, and my application for work with
the Ross Mathematics Foundation will not be processed further.

My United States social security number is \blank{2in}{SSN}{SSN}.
