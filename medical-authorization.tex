I understand that every reasonable effort will be made to contact me
at the contact information I have provided in the event of an
emergency.  In the event that I cannot be located immediately, the
authorities of the Ross Mathematics Foundation may take such temporary
measures as they deem necessary.  I give permission to Central Ohio
Primary Care or other physicians selected by the Ross Mathematics
Foundation to treat, hospitalize, order injection, anesthesia, or surgery
for the Participant.  I give permission for the release of this health

To the best of my knowledge and belief, the Participant is and has
been in normal good health and is free from all communicable or
contagious diseases. Should the Participant manifest any condition
where there appears to be reasonable grounds for suspecting the
presence of a communicable or contagious disease, I agree that a
physical examination may be performed. Also, I agree that if any such
disease is found, the Participant will comply with the regular
quarantine or isolation procedures of the camp and of the community.
I agree that the Participant will submit to surveillance testing for
COVID--19 which may include mandatory antigen or PCR tests.
