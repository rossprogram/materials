\maketitle

The fee charged to Ross Program participants is used to pay for six
weeks of room and board and for some of the instructional costs.
\begin{quote}
Total Fee is \totalfee
\end{quote}

If you live abroad and cannot pay by credit card or provide a paper
check, you may instead pay participation fees by emailing
\texttt{ross@rossproram.org} to arrange an electronic funds wire
transfer.

Your email must include your bank information, the name on the account
from which you are sending the funds, and the total amount of the wire
transfer in USD.  You are responsible for all wire transfer fees;
include sufficient funds to cover your bank's origination fee, any
currency conversion fees, and an additional \$15 to cover our bank's
incoming wire fee.  Furthermore, \textbf{be sure that the wire
  transfer instructions include the participant's full name} so that
we may credit your account.
