Ohio Dominican University (ODU) is located at 1216 Sunbury Road, Columbus, OH 43219

The University's web page 
\href{https://www.ohiodominican.edu/future-students/admissions-aid/visit-odu/locations}{Visit ODU}  provides directions for driving to the ODU campus.  Near the bottom of that page, click on ``Directions.''   

When you get to the campus, drive to \dormname\ (our dorm) and park behind the building.  \\
Here are more precise directions:

\spa Sunbury Road runs north and south, passing through the ODU campus.\\
\spa There is one traffic light on Sunbury Road at ODU. \\
\spa \dormname\ is north of that traffic light, on the east side of Sunbury.
 
 {\bf Driving north} on Sunbury: The driveway for  \dormname\ is the first right turn after that traffic signal.  ``Check-In'' signs should be there on Ross arrival day,: Sunday June 23.

 {\bf Driving south} on Sunbury: If you miss the left turn to \dormname's driveway,  you will need to turn around and go back north.\\

A University staff person, or a Ross counselor, will meet you behind
the dorm building to provide room keys and/or key-card.  You will then
perform a COVID--19 antigen test.  If the test is negative, then you
can unload your belongings and put them into your room.

Ross Orientation meeting:  7:00 PM on Tuesday June 14 in \orientationlocation.
